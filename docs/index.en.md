## Welcome

Welcome to **Radify Menu Editor**! This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using this visual IDE for creating AutoHotkey v2 ring menus without writing a single line of code.

## About This Tool

When creating GUI launchers or ring menus with AutoHotkey v2, developers often face challenges with "coordinate calculations" and "complex array definitions." **Radify Menu Editor** solves these problems by providing a complete visual development environment for the sophisticated **"Radify"** ring menu library - allowing you to configure every detail without writing code while maintaining the flexibility of full-scratch development.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Complete GUI Interface
No need to open a text editor. All configuration can be done through the visual interface.

### Real-Time Preview
Changes are immediately reflected in the center canvas (**Live Sync**). Zero waiting time when experimenting with font sizes, icon placements, or circle divisions.

### Flexible Action Definition
Combines beginner-friendly "templates" with advanced "full script writing." You can directly write AutoHotkey v2 code, including complex logic like `if WinActive(...)` conditionals and variable operations.

### Screen Capture Integration
With a single button click in the editor, capture a portion of the screen, automatically resize it, and apply it as an icon. This intuitive workflow of capturing "this button from this app" dramatically lowers the barrier to menu creation.

### Drag & Drop
Intuitively edit menu structure in the tree view. Easily rearrange items and change hierarchies.

### Undo/Redo Support
Full editing history management with `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` to support meticulous menu creation.

### Automatic Backup
Editing data is managed in robust JSON format, with automatic backups (history retention) created on save.

### Portable Export
Using the **"Export as Standalone Package"** feature, you can compile the generated AHK script along with required library files (Lib/) and image resources (images/) into a single structured folder.
